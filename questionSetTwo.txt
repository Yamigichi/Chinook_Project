Question 1:
Use your query to return the email, first name, last name, and Genre of all Rock Music listeners. 
Return your list ordered alphabetically by email address starting with A.

I chose to link information from the Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, and Genre tables, 
but you may be able to find another way to get at the information.

Check Your Solution
From my query, I found that all of the customers have a connection to Rock music (you could see this by looking at the original length of the customers table). 
Your final table should have 59 rows and 4 columns (if you want to check the connection to 'Rock' music). The header of this table is provided below.

Question 2: 

Who is writing the rock music?
Now that we know that our customers love rock music, we can decide which musicians to invite to play at the concert.

Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. 
Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.

You will need to use the Genre, Track , Album, and Artist tables.

Question 3:

First, find which artist has earned the most according to the InvoiceLines?

Now use this artist to find which customer spent the most on this artist.

For this query, you will need to use the Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Customer, Album, and Artist tables.

Notice, this one is tricky because the Total spent in the Invoice table might not be on a single product, 
so you need to use the InvoiceLine table to find out how many of each product was purchased, and then multiply this by the price for each artist.
