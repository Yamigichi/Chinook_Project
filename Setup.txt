Let's set up your local environment
It's totally fine to get started learning SQL here in the classroom, but the way to really master your skills is to get a local setup and learn to work within your own environment.

The next few problems are going to help make sure you are comfortable working locally. Once you're set up you'll be able to use this workspace not only for this project...but BEYOND!

The environment we'll use is pretty quick to set up and hopefully you'll be up and running in no time :)

All you'll need to do here is...

Download your new database
Download DB Browser for SQLite
As soon as you have DB Broswer for SQLite connected to your new database you're ready for the next page!

Download DB Browser for SQLite
Many different database browsers work with different types of databases. For this course, we'll be using the DB Browser for SQLite. The other browsers you may use will likely be very similar.

DB Browser for SQLite can be downloaded from their website in the downloads sections. Choose the right version (Windows/Mac) for your computer setup.

Download the right version for your computer setup.

Download Database
Download the Chinook database we will be using for this project. It is also available at the bottom of the page.

Connect the Browser to the Database
Here are the steps:

Open up DB Browser to SQLite
Click on Open Database
Navigate to the Chinook.db file (probably in your downloads)
Click on the Execute SQL
Start querying your data
